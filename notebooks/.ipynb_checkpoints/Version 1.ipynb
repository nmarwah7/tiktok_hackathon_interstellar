      "We went to Marmaris with my wife for a holiday. We chose this restaurant as a place for dinner based on the reviews and because we wanted juicy food. When we first went there was a serious queue. You proceed by taking the food you want in the form of an open buffet. Both vegetable dishes and meat dishes were plentiful. There was also dessert for those who wanted it. After you get what you want you pay at the cashier. They don't go through cards they work in cash. There was a lot of food variety. And the food prices were unbelievably cheap. We paid only 84 TL for all the meals here. It included buttermilk and bread. But unfortunately I can't say it's too clean as a place.. \n",

      "During my holiday in Marmaris we ate here to fit the food. It's really good that the food is cheap and nice. Eating as much bread as you want is a big plus for those who are not satisfied without bread. It is a place that I can recommend to those who will go to Marmaris. On July 1 there was a small increase but even the price hike is cheap. I leave the photo of the latest prices and breakfast below. there was a serious queue.

      "We tent camped here for 2 nights while exploring Valdez. The center of the campground was in the open and there are treed sites around the edges. Don't expect lower foliage separating the sites. Still this is much nicer than the other RV parking lots in town which seemed wide open. There is a bath house with 1 set of coin operated washer/dryer, 2 restrooms (sink toilet) and 2 shower rooms (sink, toilet, shower). The hot water will run out after a few showers. They provide floor mats towels for you to use which is nice, but they lack vent fans to remove moisture so it is prone to mold. Wi-Fi didn't reach our site on the back edge of the campground. Overall we were happy with our stay at this campground and would stay there again. \n",
